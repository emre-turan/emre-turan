# hello. 

I'm Emre, and here's a little about me:

* Developer by day, DJ by night. I juggle between crafting top-tier code and dropping fresh beats.
* Avid movie and TV show consumer, always on the lookout for the next captivating plot twist.
* Keeping up with the latest in web dev, one line of code at a time.
* Living in the rhythm of music and code.
